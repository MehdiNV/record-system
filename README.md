# record-system
##### Author: Mehdi Naderi Varandi
Mock University system that maintains a record of relevant information (e.g. module information, supervisors, pass rates, etc) for students.

The aim of this project is less on having an actual functioning system, and more instead on practicing good Object Oriented & Defensive Programming design; the focus is essentially solely on good practice and good code design.
